# AVRust

An AVR emulator in Rust

## Why the hell would I do this?

I'm building a system that generated AVR binaries based on an IDE that I'm writing.
I'd like to have a nice way to be able to write tests and be able to run on a
simulated AVR device.

Yes, I enjoy shaving yaks, but I have not been able to find an AVR emulator.  Maybe
because people think it's silly, or maybe people don't do TDD for embedded devices,
who knows, but soon, I'll have a basic AVR emulator that I can use for tests, etc.

## Where can I find more information?

* [Atmel Atmega328p datasheet](http://www.atmel.com/images/Atmel-8271-8-bit-AVR-Microcontroller-ATmega48A-48PA-88A-88PA-168A-168PA-328-328P_datasheet_Complete.pdf)

## Contribute?

Yes, I'm always looking for contributors.  Pull requests, questions, issues, whatever.
